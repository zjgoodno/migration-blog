Our train arrived in Vancouver in the early morn. After one last breakfast on the train, we said good-bye to our new friends, Michele and John, and started  noodling around Vancouver fully loaded (with gear that is). I (Glen) can’t believe how heavy it is. Of course, no one is requiring me to carry all this stuff. In any event, it is a beautiful city. Had delicious coffee and pastry in front of curious dogs and then biked around the city perimeter on miles and miles of bike trails.  The weather did not disappoint our expectations:  it has alternated between sun, clouds, rain and drizzle. Generally in the mid-60s (including the two of us). First day biking was about 22 miles. Instead of heading directly to the Adventure Cycling Association Pacific Coast Trail, we diverted to Vancouver Island.

The next day, after staying at the bike-friendly Accent Inn (LINK), we biked to the ferry terminal to get to Vancouver Island, upon which sits Victoria and several smaller towns. The ride to the ferry terminal was a bit industrial, and required wheeling over a couple of big bridges (with decent protected bike lanes) and riding on busy roads. Pam did a cracker jack job navigating us to the terminal. No easy task. The ferry was quite large, with hundreds of cars, and transporting many people. We met one other cyclist on the ferry, a young  man who had biked from Montreal to Vancouver over the month of August. The ferry deposited us in Sidney, a small, very cool, little town on the water.

Riding around the harbor, our total mileage for the day was about 33. 

Our next destination was Victoria, recommended to us by our friends Jeff and Abby, as a UK-like little city. We biked from Sidney to Victoria, and on to one of British Columbia’s  Provincial Parks for our first night of camping. It was our first time sleeping on our high tech little mats, but we managed pretty well. Total mileage, about 35. 

Victoria has many amazing bike trails. The British Columbian, and Canadian, governments have invested heavily in bike infrastructure. There are so many good ones in Victoria that we were actually complaining about the complexity of the system. The  investment has resulted in oodles of bike riders.

Another delicious bakery at breakfast time, and we toured around Victoria all day. It is BEAUTIFUL! They actually have an official airport consisting entirely of seaplanes in the harbor.  The weather held out and we rode along their extensive waterfront, again with well-marked bike trails everywhere. Lunch in Chinatown- we are making it a point to stop in all Chinatowns along the way. We spent the night at an  acupuncturist’s air bnb (of course, where else) with the sound of little feet above us. Mileage, about 25. 

So, after biking around  coastal British Columbia for the first 4 days of our trip, we are headed to Washington State, by ferry, and the ACA route in the morning.

Finally, I would like to unequivocally state that, so far, I (Pam), have had nothing to do with the Instagram posts. Glen can confirm that this is a true statement.

As far as moving out here (Victoria in particular), I  (Glen) doubt it, as our friends and family are all in Maine and environs. It is tempting given the culture, infrastructure and environment. Biking would be near year-round. But it could never really be home. I could see coming back here and spending a month or two in the fall. I have a feeling I may feel like this about many places we visit.  Pam?
