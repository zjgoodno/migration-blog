We drove to Montreal to meet our friends Jeff and Abbey who had agreed to take our car back to Vermont with them while we gallivant around for the next nine months.  We had a great time biking around the city and eating delicious food.  Boarding a train to Toronto, an all day affair, we had our first taste of Canadian train travel.  It was wonderful.  Just relax and look out the window.  Don’t think of the pain that is coming.

Our first time in Toronto  it’s a beautiful and very big city.  We biked around and found Chinatown with delicious food, always a high and sometimes overriding, priority. We zeroed in on Yummy Yummy, supposedly the best dumpling place in Montreal. It did not disappoint, with quite savory fish and fungi steamed dumplings, handmade in the back within our view. Sated, we headed out for an amazing 30 plus mile ride all along Lake Ontario. Glen would return to Yummy Yummy for another session with the dumplings the following day, while next door Pam had what turned out to be an excellent, very deep tissue, massage.

After two days in Toronto*, we boarded The Canadian:  the train that would take us to Vancouver in five days.  It is very cool.  It is a ‘historical’ train with some old-fashioned features but very updated for us modern people. This is the train featured in the movie Festival Express, where Janice Joplin, the Band etc. took a crazy trip across Canada playing music the whole time. Maybe not 100% comfortable at all times but our bunks are cozy, the food delicious and the views ever-changing.  We are among the youngest on the train (!) but every one is very friendly.  Most are Canadian, American, Australian, German, and British.  You are always seated with strangers at every meal  which is not our usual preference  but we make the best and everyone thinks we are actually friendly.

We have traveled through Ontario (looks just like Maine), Manitoba (a brief jaunt in Winnipeg), Saskatchewan (and now Vancouver). The middle of Canada is flat flat farmland and you can see forever.  I can understand when these folks come to the Northeast they feel hemmed in by all the trees. 

Losing an hour each day or so due to time zone changes, we find ourselves perpetually a bit tired, and fall naturally, and often, into little naps. Rolling into Jaspar, Alberta at about 6 AM, Pam is pounding on the bottom of Glen’s upper bunk to get the hell up and check out the Rockies. We had slipped into amazing mountain scenery while asleep. Glen obliged and after a quick breakfast, checked out the town of Jaspar. It’s a little like Jackson, Wyoming, and sits in the middle of Jaspar National Park. We are told to return in two hours or face banishment somewhere in the park. We are obedient. The Canadian Rockies were incredible!!

Next: getting into Vancouver. 

*We will definitely go back and recommend that you do too.
